# illumio-test-repo


1.     how you tested your solution
  I haven't tested my solution yet, as it isn't working

2.     any interesting coding, design, or algorithmic choices you’d like to point out
  I chose to make a class to hold an IP address, and a class to hold a NAT entry. Then, I could hash the NAT_entries by their "from" IP, and so I had a very quick and easy lookup to see if an IP from our FLOW had hashed into an IP in out NAT.
  
3.     any refinements or optimizations that you would’ve implemented if you had more time
  I would have tested so that I could make sure it'd work, and I'm sure that I could improve the hash function if I was given time to test.

4.     how you modified or made the challenge more well defined if you did
  I assumed that all input would be valind/well-formed, and that there'd be exactly one entry per line for each file.
  
5.     anything else you’d like the reviewer to know
  I've never done a coding challenge like this, all of the stuff I've ever done has been on https://www.hackerrank.com/, it's a pretty sweet site, and I think they make distributing questions like this really easy. Unless, of course, you were also testing me on my ability to use Git, then using HackerRank to distribute the question kinda takes away from that.
